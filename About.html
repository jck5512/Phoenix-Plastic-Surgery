	All of our surgeons have been certified in adolescent surgery, the newest surgery technique that allows minors to be operated on in an invasive way. This new technique has been evolved to accommodate the necessity of our young women to maintain the most beautiful figure and appearance that they can. It allows girls to combat the dissatisfaction of imperfect body types and attributes in the adolescent stage. By adapting technology to the needs of society, we offer a new, safe alternative to body modification solutions. This innovative practice is taught to only the most experienced surgeons. It is a technique that allows for surgeons to learn ways to surgically manipulate the sensitive anatomy of adolescents to be constructed in a desirable manner. Adolescent surgery includes all common cosmetic procedures: rib cage reconstruction, extreme liposuction, extreme fat transfer, and bone shaving or removal. These cosmetic procedures now becoming available to adolescents will finally allow young women to achieve their body image ideals at ages younger than ever before. Young girls will finally be happy with the way that they look because of these amazing advancements in technology. We are so happy to be one of the first establishments to provide these amazing enhancements to young girls nationally and internationally.
