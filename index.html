	According to Park Nicollet Medical Center, in 2018, 80% of 10 year olds were afraid of being fat. Now, thanks to PHOENIX Plastic Surgery, young women are able to overcome this fear and maintain an important and influential spot in society through our procedures. Our surgeons specialize in adolescent surgery, a new practice focused on invasive cosmetic surgery specifically on the adolescent frame. This practice allows surgeons to essentially surpass the previous ideas of biological limitations of surgery to give you the body you and society have always wanted. We have defined two main procedures which allow our patients to maintain the body shape that they have always desired - one allowing for a skinnier shape, or a curvier shape, both extremely desirable by every woman today. Our surgeries include invasive procedures to the bone structure which allow you to grow with and into the body that we all desire. Please consider us and our amazing new technology for achieving your body image needs.</h3></main>
