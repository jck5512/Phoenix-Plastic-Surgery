<h4>I first considered Phoenix Surgery at age 10 when I realized I didn't look like the girls on television or social media. I didn’t have that perfect round bottom and chest, and no one paid attention to me. I couldn’t move forward in my education or opportunities because I was being ignored...until the Stormi K. At age 13 I decided to take the leap and I went with the Stormi K because I was so focused on curvature. The recovery was easier than the braces I had at the time. There is no reason to keep holding yourself back in life by not allowing yourself to be beautiful. Stop holding yourself back. Be like me, get the Stormi K. </h4>

<h4>I wasn’t anyone until I came to Phoenix. I was interested in starting my own brand in my teenage years but no one would listen to my proposals. After the Influencer, I finally got the clout that I was looking for. People wanted to pay attention to me because I had what they were looking for - beautiful skin, an attractive body, and no cellulite. Without Phoenix I would never have been able to start my own clothing brand and be where I am today. Phoenix allows young girls to reach the height of their potential.</h4>
