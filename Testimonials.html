<h4>I first considered Phoenix Surgery at age 10 when I realized I didn't look like the girls on television or social media. I didn’t have that perfect round bottom and chest, and no one paid attention to me. I couldn’t move forward in my life because of the lack of opportunities...I was being ignored...until the Stormi K. At age 13 I decided to take the leap and I went with the Stormi K because I was so done with being a no one in life. All of the most successful women are either this shape, or skinnier, and I wanted success in my life as well. The recovery was hard, but easier than the braces that I had at the time. Phoenix allows you to maintain your life as an adolescent while also focusing on your body image. There is no reason to keep holding yourself back in life by not allowing yourself to be beautiful. Get the Stormi K, get ahead in life, and forget about the body that was holding you back from your greatest opportunities in life. </h4>

<h4>I wasn’t anyone until I came to Phoenix. I was interested in starting my own brand as a teenager but unfortunately my self marketing was completely unsuccessful. Because I didn’t look the part, I couldn’t advertise my company. In today’s business world you just need a certain look in order to be taken seriously and in our world to be successful you need to maintain a certain standard. Without PHOENIX, many of us would not be able to achieve the success that we have at such a young age. Phoenix gives us adolescent girls the ability to create success for ourselves in today’s world. I went with the Social Influencer as a procedure in order to get my confidence and my sales up. After the procedure, I finally got the attention and focus that I deserved. People finally cared about my brand and the clothing I wanted to sell because I was beautiful. Without Phoenix, I would be nothing. </h4>
